				<h1><img src="../hqlogo.png" height="80"
						style="position:relative; right: 2px; top: 22px" />&nbsp;Bconomy Bot Rules and Conduct</h1>
				<h4>By using Bconomy, you automatically agree to our <a href="https://bcono.my/tos">Terms of Service</a>. Please also review our <a href="https://bcono.my/pp">Privacy Policy</a>.</h4>
				<h2>1. No Inappropriate Content</h2>
				<p>Inappropriate names, emoji, profiles, or banners (for pets, factions, etc) are not allowed. This includes names or media that in any way mention politics, religion, contain links, encourages illegal behavior, are advertisements, contain lewd or pornographic content, are harmful or discriminatory, or are otherwise deemed controversial or explicit by staff. What is considered inappropriate is at the discretion of Bconomy and may change at any moment.</p>
				<h2>2. No External Trading</h2>
				<p>Do not trade Bconomy items and currency ("Bcoins"/"BC") for anything outside the game. This includes other bot or Discord items or currency, anything of real-world value, and any other good or service. Items or currency may be removed from your account if there is suspicion of external trading. Items and currency are not redeemable for real-world money.</p>
				<h2>3. No Cheats or Automation</h2>
				<p>Cheats or automation (including but not limited to: selfbotting, scripting, autotyping, macros, keyboard shortcuts) are not allowed and are against Discord ToS. This will result in an irreversible bot ban. We have many ways to detect this! Suspected cheaters may be permanently banned without notice or an opportunity to appeal.</p>
				<h2>4. No Alternate Accounts</h2>
				<p>Any individual may only have 1 Bconomy account at any given time. Alternate accounts for the purpose of gameplay are not allowed, and use of them to gain an unfair advantage will lead to a permaban.</p>
				<h2>5. No Bug Exploiting</h2>
				<p>Exploiting bugs or glitches is not allowed and will lead to a ban. Please report these instead for the benefit of the community!</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>As stated in our Terms of Service, your account may be terminated for any of the above reasons, or at our discretion. If you have any additional questions or would like clarification please visit our <a href="https://discord.gg/GdeeNGZsBq">Discord Support Server</a>.</p>
